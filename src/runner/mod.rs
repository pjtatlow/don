//! Runner — the orchestrator that starts services and tasks in dependency order.
//!
//! The runner builds an execution plan via topological sort, then starts
//! everything whose dependencies are satisfied concurrently using tokio tasks.
//! It owns all service/task state in a plain `HashMap` — no `Arc<Mutex<>>`.
//! Communication uses channels: `mpsc` for commands in, `broadcast` for events out.
